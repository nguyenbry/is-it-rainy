# Is It Rainy?

This is a simple weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the current weather for the searched location, as well as a 5 day forecast.

This project features Radix UI and Colors, NextJS server components, and TailwindCSS. Most of the app is server-rendered.

### Get started

1. Create a `.env` file at the root and insert your OpenWeatherMap API key:

```
OPENWEATHER_KEY="{my_key_here}"
```

2. Install dependencies using `pnpm i`
3. Start the development server using `pnpm dev`
